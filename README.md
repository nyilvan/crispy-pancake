# CFG Python Course Project

## Code First Girls: Introduction to Python and Apps
I took the Introduction to Python and Apps course run by Code First Girls in 2024 August to start my transition from a Tech Recruiter with a decade of experience in Tech companies to an Engineer.
This was my first experience of Python. 

The course covered the following topics over the course of 8 weeks (2 hours per week):
1. Data types, variables and operations
2. Input, loops and functions
3. If statements
4. Lists and dictionaries
5. Files, modules and APIs
6. Project planning and group project


After finishing the mandatory main project I decided to play around with an extension to it.
I took the BoardGameGeek public CS and created a basic search tool to get a list of boardgames based on a keyword, ordered by ranking on the website. And I hope to take this further in the future to continue learning.

I did not use any additional packages and only Pycharm as the editor.
